\begin{frame}{Disadvantages}
It has some disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \small Costly online visibility checking
    \item \small {An incremental construction can easily reach to $O(V^2)$}
    \item \small {Duplicated effort:\\
    the VG is discarded each time the $q$ changes}
\end{itemize}
