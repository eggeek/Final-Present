\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed algorithms outcompte \textit{LVG} in all cases
        \item \textit{Interval heuristic} works well when targets are many
        \item \textit{Target heuristic} works well when targets are few and $k$ is also small
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \small{
            Proposed algorithms can be used to speed up other types of spatial query which need to compute obstacle distance, e.g. \textit{Obstacle Reverse Nearest Neighbor}.
        }
        \item \small {
          Another interesting direction is improve \textit{target heuristic}, which cost $\approx 80\%$ of total run time to find the closet target.
        }
    \end{itemize}
